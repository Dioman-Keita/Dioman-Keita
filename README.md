# Hi, I'm Dioman Keita 👋

## 🚀 Full Stack Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a passionate full stack developer with a focus on building robust, scalable, and thoughtful applications. My core stack revolves around **Vanilla JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, **React**, **Node.js**, and **Express**. I strive to bring clarity and purpose to every line of code I write.

### 💡 Programming Philosophy

> **"Every program or code has a heart—the central nucleus (noyau)—and all parts gravitate around it."**

I believe in identifying and nurturing the core of every project. My development is guided by the paradigm of **Programmation Oriented Answer**: delivering solutions that are meaningful, precise, and centered on the project's true needs.
