### 💡 Programming Philosophy

> **"Every program or code has a heart—the central nucleus (noyau)—and all parts gravitate around it."**

I believe in identifying and nurturing the core of every project. My development is guided by the paradigm of **Programmation Oriented Answer**: delivering solutions that are meaningful, precise, and elegant.

### 🔒 Development Principle

**Confidentiality above all.**  
Respecting the privacy and integrity of data is at the core of my work and values.
